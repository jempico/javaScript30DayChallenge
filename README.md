Project 2/30 from WesBos JavaScript30 challenge, consisting on building 30 things in 30 days with pure JavaScript.

Things I've learned while doing it:
1. How to use the setInterval() method to create a function that grabs de current time every second, and then turns each second, minute and hour into a degree.
2. Kept practicing how to change the style of an HTML element, in this case, how to move each hand according to the corresponding rotation degrees.
