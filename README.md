Project 2/30 from WesBos JavaScript30 challenge, consisting on building 30 things in 30 days with pure JavaScript.

Things I've learned while doing it:
1. How to create a realtime analog clock using the Date constructor and the setInterval method.
2. Kept practicing how to change the style of an HTML element, in this case, how to move each hand according to the corresponding rotation degrees.
3. How to push a project, make a pull request and merge files in Github using the command line.
